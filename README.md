# Text-level-classification

## Project Overview
This project develops a machine learning model to predict the difficulty level of French texts, enabling English speakers learning French to access reading materials that are appropriate for their proficiency level. Hosted as part of a [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/predicting-the-difficulty-of-a-french-text-e4s/overview), our model classifies texts into CEFR levels from A1 to C2 to support personalized learning experiences.

## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to provide learners with an automated tool that identifies the difficulty level of French texts. By doing so, learners can engage with materials that are neither too easy nor too hard, enhancing both learning efficiency and engagement.

## Data Utilization
We use labeled training data and unlabeled test data provided by the competition organizers to train and validate our models. These models are designed to streamline the assessment of text difficulty for educational purposes.

## Technical Development
Our approach includes:
- **Multi-input Neural Network**: Analyzes linguistic features to predict text difficulty.
- **Fine-tuning of the Camembert Model**: Adapts this robust language model to better understand the nuances of French texts, improving its predictive accuracy.

## Repository Insights
The GitHub repository showcases:
- Comparative analysis of various machine learning models like Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.
- Evaluations based on precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy metrics.
- Confusion matrix and detailed error analysis to refine model predictions.
- Further explorations to deepen understanding of model behavior.
